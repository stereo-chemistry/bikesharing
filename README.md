## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of NYC Citi Bike  data in Tableau. "Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens".<sup>[1]</sup> This analysis utilizes a .csv file of August 2019 NYC Citi Bike, a Python Pandas Dataframe in Jupyter Notebook to transform some data, and Tableau to visualize the data. Tableau excels in forming data visualizations that are easy to interpret by nontechnical stakeholders, coworkers and consumers.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to break NYC Citi Bike data into sophisticated visualizations in order to determine and support the eligibility of opening a similar bike rental service in Des Moines, IA. In order to determine and support the eligibility for a similar bike rental service in Des Moines, this project aims to break the NYC Citi Bike data for August 2019 into relevant pieces that can be easily visualized and studied in Tableau. Data analysis in Tabeau gives most popular starting destinations, peak hours of use, and analysis of bike use by time of day, day of week, gender and customer vs. subscriber.
